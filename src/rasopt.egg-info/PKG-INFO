### rasopt - a HEC-RAS calibration tool
Rasopt is your one stop shop for efficient calibration of the HEC-RAS 2D flood model.
Rasopt is a Python wrapper that allows for calibration of model parameters using 
a suite of optimization algorithms, both out-of-the-box or user supplied. At it's core, rasopt 
creates an environment that facilitates easy running of the HEC-RAS model in a programmatic 
way, thus sidestepping the cumbersome GUI that is required to run HEC-RAS normally.
